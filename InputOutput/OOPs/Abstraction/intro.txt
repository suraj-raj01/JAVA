Abstraction in java refers to hiding implementation details of a code and exposed
only the necessary information to the user.

java
1. Using abstract class
2. Using Interface

Abstract class:
Abstract class is the collection of abstract
method or non abstract method

We cannot create an instance / object of
Abstract class

Abstract class can have a constructor

Abstract class can inherit another abstract or
non abstract class

An abstract class can implement any
interfaces

The abstract keywords in an non-access
modifier, used for classes and methods

Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class,and it does not have a body
/definition. The definition / body
/implementation provided by its child classes.

Abstract class: Ia a restricted class that
cannot be used to create objects. It must be
inherited from another class

We cannot create an object of abstract class
but it can store reference of its child class.
