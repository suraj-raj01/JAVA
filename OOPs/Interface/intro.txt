Q1.Explain interface in java programming?
Ans: we can also achieve abstraction in java programming with interface

Using interface we achieve 100% abstraction in java because by default every method in
interface is public and abstract

No need to use abstract keyword in interface

Interface is a collection of method declaration
and final variable

Interface keyword is used to declare interface
A class can implements any number of
interfaces at a time

A interface can extends more than one
interface at a time(Multiple inheritance)

We cannot create an instance / object of
interface, but it can store the reference of its
implemented class.

Apart from interface method a implemented
class can have its own method

interface Ia{
int x=10;
void a();

}

interface Ib{
int y=20;
void b();

}

class Test implements Ia,Ib{

public void a(){
System.out.println(&quot;Ia INterface method :
&quot;+x);
}
public void b(){
System.out.println(&quot;Ib INterface method :
&quot;+y);
}

public void hello(){
System.out.println(&quot;This is Test class
Method&quot;);
}
public static void main(String args[]){
//Ia obj=new Ia();//C.E.
Ia obj=new Test();

obj.a();
//obj.hello();
Test t=new Test();
t.hello();
t.a();
t.b();
}
}
